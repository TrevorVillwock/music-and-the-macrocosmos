                    <p>Conway's Game of Life is a type of cellular automaton invented by the British mathematician John Conway in 1970. 
                    <p>Cellular automata are mathematical systems defined by a set of cells that interact with the cells around them according to a set of rules. The Game of Life is a 2D automaton, but cellular automata with any number of dimensions are possible.</p>
                    <p>Each cell has its own state defined by a certain number of parameters; in Conway's Game of Life the cells have only one parameter, which is whether they are "alive." </p>
                    <p>The rules according to <a href="http://www.conwaylife.com">conwaylife.com</a> are as follows:</p>
                    <ul></ul>
                        <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies (referred to as underpopulation).</li>
                        <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies (referred to as overpopulation).</li>
                        <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives, unchanged, to the next generation.</li>
                        <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours comes to life.</li>
                    <p>Conventionally, the game of life takes place on an infinite grid, but this version uses a finite 10x10 one. This creates interesting effects along the
                        borders as cells with only 3 or 4 neighbors will respond differently to the rules.</p>
                    <p>Click a square to make it alive or click and drag to select multiple squares. Once you have created the pattern you want, press the spacebar to begin running the clock. 
                        Pressing the spacebar again will stop the clock.</p>
                    <p>Each square is mapped to a note of the G major pentatonic scale (G, A, B, D, E). Each row of 10 squares repeats the scale twice in a particular octave. The first five rows start on G6, G5, G4, G3, and G2 and the last five rows repeat that pattern. </p>
