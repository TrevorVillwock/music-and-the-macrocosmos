                    <p>Conway's Game of Life is a type of cellular automaton invented by the British mathmetician John Conway in 1970. 
                    <p>Cellular automata are mathematical systems defined by a set of cells that interact with the cells around them according to a set of rules.</p>
                    <p>Each cell has its own state defined by a certain number of parameters; in Conway's Game of Life the cells have only one parameter, which is whether they are "alive." </p>
                    <p>The rules according to <a href="http://www.conwaylife.com">conwaylife.com</a> are as follows:</p>
                    <ul></ul>
                        <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies (referred to as underpopulation).</li>
                        <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies (referred to as overpopulation).</li>
                        <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives, unchanged, to the next generation.</li>
                        <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours comes to life.</li>
                    <p>The Game of Life is a 2D automaton, but cellular automata with any number of dimensions are possible.</p>
                    <p>Click a square to make it alive. Once you have created the pattern you want, press the spacebar to begin running the clock.</p>
                    <p>Pressing the spacebar again will stop the clock.</p>
                    <p>Each square is mapped to a note of the G major pentatonic scale.</p>
