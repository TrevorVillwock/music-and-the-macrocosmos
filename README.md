After installing npm, install the npm package http-server globally from the command line with `npm install -g http-server`. 

To run a project, navigate to the folder of the desired project using the `cd` (change directory) command, for example `cd squares`.

For Hex Grid, run:
`npm i`
`npm run dev`
