    /* You might notice here that the volumes of the pitches are different. Why is this?
    The human ear is naturally more sensitive to higher sounds, so they are percieved as slightly
    louder than low sounds even if the measured amplitude (height) of the waves was the same.
    Be careful not to confuse amplitude and frequency however. The amplitude of a wave is what we perceive 
    as volume and is the measurement of a soundwave from crest to trough. On an x-y graph of a soundwave, this
    is the vertical axis or y-axis. The frequency is the rate at which the wave oscillates and is measured in Hertz (Hz). 
    One Hertz is one complete cycle of the wave per second, 2 is twice per second, etc.
